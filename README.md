# GRFICSv3 —  Open Source OT Security Lab

> **GRFICSv3** is a fully containerized OT / ICS cyber-physical security lab that simulates a industrial chemical plant.
> It brings together realistic process dynamics, industrial protocols, engineering tools, and attacker infrastructure all inside Docker.
>
> Use it to explore **ICS / OT security**, practice **incident response**, or develop and test **defensive and offensive tools** in a safe, hands-on environment.

## Mac + Multi-Browser Lab Guide

This fork adds a simple visual walkthrough for running GRFICSv3 on macOS with Homebrew, Docker CLI, Docker Compose, and Colima. It also documents how to use the Mac as a local lab server so separate browsers or separate computers can open the simulation, Kali attacker machine, Caldera, Wazuh defender dashboard, HMI, PLC, and engineering workstation at the same time.

Start here:

- [Running lab playbook: Kali, Caldera, Wazuh, IDS, and Modbus commands](GRFICSv3_RUNNING_LAB_PLAYBOOK.md)
- [Student lab worksheet / guided notes](GRFICSv3_LAB_WORKSHEET.md)
- [Visual step-by-step guide](GRFICSv3_VISUAL_STEP_BY_STEP_GUIDE.md)
- [Remote browser access notes](GRFICSv3_REMOTE_ACCESS.md)
- [Installation writeup](GRFICSv3_INSTALL_WRITEUP.md)

### Mac as the Lab Server

When GRFICSv3 runs on your Mac, each service is published as a browser-accessible port. On the Mac itself, use `localhost`. On another computer on the same Wi-Fi/LAN, use the Mac's IP address instead.

Example layout:

| View | On the Mac | From another computer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Simulation | `http://localhost` | `http://MAC_IP` |
| Kali attacker | `http://localhost:6088` | `http://MAC_IP:6088` |
| Caldera | `http://localhost:8888` | `http://MAC_IP:8888` |
| Wazuh defender | `http://localhost:5601` | `http://MAC_IP:5601` |
| HMI | `http://localhost:6081` | `http://MAC_IP:6081` |
| PLC | `http://localhost:8080` | `http://MAC_IP:8080` |
| Engineering Workstation | `http://localhost:6080` | `http://MAC_IP:6080` |

Find the Mac's current LAN IP with:

```bash
ipconfig getifaddr en0
```

For access outside the local network, use a private overlay network such as Tailscale rather than forwarding these lab services directly to the public internet.

## 🎯 Who is GRFICS for?

GRFICSv3 is designed for anyone learning or teaching **OT and ICS security**, including:

- OT / ICS security practitioners and engineers
- Blue teams and incident responders training on industrial environments
- Red teams exploring ICS-specific attack paths
- Educators building hands-on industrial cybersecurity labs
- Researchers developing or testing OT security tools

If you’ve ever wanted a realistic **OT security lab** without racks of hardware,
this is for you.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **End-to-end OT / ICS security lab** — PLCs, HMIs, engineering workstations, routers, and attacker tools
* **3D process visualization** — watch tank levels and valves respond in real time
* **Virtual Walkthroughs** — explore the warehouse in first person, observing physical layouts and security lapses 
* **Built-in attack & defense tools** — Kali Linux, MITRE Caldera, a custom firewall and Suricata IDS interface, and an optional Wazuh SIEM
* **Modular, containerized design** — launch everything with a single `docker compose up`
* **Realistic networking** — segmented process and enterprise zones with controllable traffic flow

## Physical Vulnerabilities & Cyber Hygiene

One of the most powerful aspects of GRFICSv3 as an **OT security lab** is the ability to
virtually walk the entire plant and warehouse.

This allows learners to understand what a real industrial environment looks like and
identify common **physical security and cyber hygiene failures**, such as:

- Passwords written on sticky notes
- Propped-open security doors
- Unlocked cabinets and control panels
- Poor separation between IT and OT spaces

As vulnerabilities are discovered, the **Vulnerabilities Found** tracker in the top-left
corner keeps score — making this ideal for self-paced learning and classroom exercises.

# 🤌 Installation

## 1. Prerequisites

* **Recommended OS:** Linux (native, VM, or WSL2)
  GRFICS uses Docker and Docker Compose. Linux provides the lightest and most reliable experience, but following Docker's instructions for Windows should work fine too.
* **Required packages:**
  * For prebuilt images - Docker and Docker Compose
  * For building from source - Docker, Docker Compose, Git, and Git LFS

You can find an example walkthrough installation video here:
https://youtu.be/X7YYCLJxMmo?si=qHRXlzfovdr3HsSZ

Otherwise, you can follow the instructions below.

Example install on Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
# Remove packages that conflict with Docker
sudo apt remove $(dpkg --get-selections docker.io docker-compose docker-compose-v2 docker-doc podman-docker containerd runc | cut -f1)

# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.sources <<EOF
Types: deb
URIs: https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu
Suites: $(. /etc/os-release && echo "${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}")
Components: stable
Signed-By: /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
EOF

sudo apt update

# Install latest version of Docker
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

# Install git
sudo apt install -y git git-lfs

# (Optional) allow non-root docker use
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Log out and back in if you added yourself to the Docker group.

## 2. Install GRFICS

You can either **pull the prebuilt images from Docker Hub** (quick and easy)  
or **build everything locally** if you want to modify or customize.

---

### 🐋 Option A: Pull prebuilt images (recommended)

The fastest way to get started — no building required!

```bash
# Download the latest docker-compose.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fortiphyd/GRFICSv3/main/docker-compose.yml

# Start GRFICS using prebuilt images from Docker Hub
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

### 🏗️ Option B: Clone and build

```bash
sudo apt install -y git git-lfs
git clone https://github.com/Fortiphyd/GRFICSv3.git
cd GRFICSv3
docker compose build
```

Start the environment:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Watch logs (optional):

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

Then open your browser and visit **[http://localhost](http://localhost)** —
you should see the 3D chemical plant simulation come to life.

# 🗞 Using GRFICS

## Starting & Stopping

* To stop all running containers:

  ```bash
  docker compose down
  ```
* To stop but keep containers/images:

  ```bash
  docker compose stop
  ```
* To restart later:

  ```bash
  docker compose start
  ```

### Optional: Wazuh SIEM

Wazuh is disabled by default (it adds ~3–4 GB and significant startup time). To include it:

```bash
docker compose --profile siem up -d
```

To stop it later, make sure to include the profile in the down command:

```bash
docker compose --profile siem down
```

Once running, the Wazuh dashboard is available at [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601) (`admin` / `admin`).
Agents installed on the router and ScadaLTS containers will automatically connect and begin forwarding logs.

# 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Network interface errors

If build or startup fails with a message about creating a network interface,
edit `docker-compose.yml` (around lines 140 and 149) to match your actual network interface name (e.g., `eth0`, `enp0s3`, or your WSL adapter).

### Permission errors

If you see `permission denied` errors running Docker commands, prefix with `sudo` or ensure your user is added to the `docker` group.

### Container won’t start

Run:

```bash
docker compose logs <service-name>
```

to view detailed logs, or `docker compose ps` to check the status of all containers.

### Resetting everything

To rebuild from scratch:

```bash
docker compose down --volumes
docker compose up -d --build
```

---

# ⚙️ Development Tips

* To rebuild a single service:

  ```bash
  docker compose build <service-name>
  docker compose up -d <service-name>
  ```
* To monitor logs interactively:

  ```bash
  docker compose logs -f
  ```
* To check which containers are running:

  ```bash
  docker compose ps
  ```
